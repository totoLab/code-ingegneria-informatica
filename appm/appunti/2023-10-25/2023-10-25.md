## Shell
- `echo $SHELL` too print the shell in use
- running a shell's executable opens a new session with that shell (regardless of the default one), e.g. `/bin/bash` to run a bash shell
- bash: Bourne Again Shell
- `.bashrc` list of commands to run before before opening every new shell session

### Variables
Variables are referenceable with `$VARIABLE_NAME`, some environment variables:
- USER
- HOSTNAME
- HOSTTYPE
- PWD
- HOME
- PATH list of directories where shell searches for executables

### `.bashrc`
To update environment variables without restarting the session, `source .bashrc`

### PATH
To add a directory to the path (for the current session) `PATH=$PATH:directory`. To make changes permanent, add this line to .bashrc
