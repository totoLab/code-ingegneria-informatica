## File System

### Comandi
- `cd`
- `tree`
- `mount` 
- `umount`
- `chmod`
- `chown`

### Properties

Hierarchy: all paths are relative to / (root)
Virtual: the purpose is to allow client applications to access different types of concrete file systems in a uniform way (network drives are seen the same as local ones). Mounting external filesystem is usually done using /mnt, /media

### File types
- d directory
- l link
- \- regular file
- c char device
- b block device  
- p pipe
- s socket

### Link
- hard links: same filesystem, files only
- symbolic links: `ln -s /path/to/file /path/to/link`

### `ls -l` output
type permissions ... group owner size date name [optional: -> symbolic link]

-rwxr-xr-x 1 toto toto    144 21 ago  2022 system-monitor.sh
drwxr-xr-x 2 toto toto   4096  1 mar  2022 templates
lrwxrwxrwx 1 toto toto     40 15 lug 10.59 tpt-server -> /home/toto/vscode/server.py

Permissions triple: (owner group user) rwx for each one.

#### Extra
`x` for directory means access (with cd)

### Permission update `chmod [OPTION] FILE`
OPTIONS:
- single permission: letter[s] +- permission FILE <br>
letters -> User Group All Others

- octal notation <br>
rwx rw- r--
111 110 100 = 764 (permission_triple) <br>
`chmod permission_triple FILE`

- `-R` recursively apply permission to subdirectories and files in them

### other commands
- `grep -r pattern file` search for pattern in file's content (recursively down the filesystem if file is a directory) 
- `cut -d "divider" -f coloumn` 

## Main filesystem's parts 
- `/` root
- `/boot` boot and bootloader files
- `/bin` main commands 
- `/lib` libraries
- `/opt` optional programs (maybe useful only to some users) 
- `/usr` 
- `/var` often altered files (like logs in `/var/log`)
- `/tmp` temporary files, everybody can write here
- `/home` personal files of all users
- `/root` home of root user
- `/etc` system-wide config files
- `/proc`, `/dev` virtual representation of os parts (`/proc` creates a directory for every process executing, `/dev` represents virtual filesystems of connected devices like disks, terminals, printers, ecc...). Directory for devices are created automatically as needed.
- `/media` contains mountpoints to removable devices `mount [OPTIONAL -t filesystem_type] /dev/usb0 /media/usb` (usb directory is not present by default)
- `/mnt` root temporary mounting directory

### Filesystem types
- ext4
- NTFS
- FAT32
- exFAT
- vfat
