## Exceptions

- can you explain to me Java exception mechanism?

In Java, an exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions. When an exception is thrown, the Java runtime system searches for an appropriate exception handler to handle it. If a suitable handler is found, the runtime system transfers control to that handler. If not, the runtime system will halt the program and display an error message.
Exceptions can be handled in Java using try-catch blocks. A try block encloses the code that might throw an exception, and a catch block contains the code that will handle the exception. If an exception is thrown within the try block, the exception is caught and handled by the catch block.
Java also allows to define your own exception class by extending Exception class.
It can also use throws keyword in the method signature to indicate that the method might throw an exception, the calling code must then handle the exception.

- What's the difference between RuntimeException and Exception

In Java, there are two main types of exceptions: checked exceptions and unchecked exceptions.

Checked exceptions are those that are derived from the Exception class and are checked by the compiler at compile-time. These are exceptions that a programmer should anticipate and handle in their code. For example, IOException or SQLException.

Unchecked exceptions are those that are derived from the RuntimeException class. They are not checked by the compiler at compile-time and are usually caused by programming errors, such as null pointer exceptions or index out of bounds exceptions.

The main difference between RuntimeException and Exception is that the former is an unchecked exception, while the latter is a checked exception. This means that code that throws a RuntimeException is not required to handle it or declare it in a throws clause, whereas code that throws a checked exception must either handle it or declare it in a throws clause.

It's worth noting that Error is an unchecked exception, but it's not related to the RuntimeException. Error indicates a serious problem that a reasonable application should not try to catch, such as OutOfMemoryError or StackOverflowError.

- Can you give me an example for checked exceptions handling?

Sure, here's an example of how to handle a checked exception in Java:

import java.io.*;

public class CheckedExceptionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            FileInputStream file = new FileInputStream("myfile.txt");
        } catch (FileNotFoundException e) {
            System.out.println("File not found");
        }
    }
}

In this example, the FileInputStream constructor throws a FileNotFoundException if the specified file cannot be found. This exception is a checked exception, so the code that calls the constructor must either handle the exception or declare it in a throws clause.

In this case, the exception is handled by a catch block that catches the FileNotFoundException and prints a message to the console. If the file is not found, the program will continue to execute after the catch block.

Alternatively, you can also use the throws keyword in the main method signature to indicate that the method might throw an exception, and the calling code must then handle the exception.

public static void main(String[] args) throws FileNotFoundException {
    FileInputStream file = new FileInputStream("myfile.txt");
}

It's up to the developer to decide which approach to use, depending on the requirements of the application and the desired behavior in case of an exception.

- If my code throws a RuntimeException is always a programming error?

Not necessarily. While a RuntimeException is often caused by a programming error, such as a NullPointerException or an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, it can also be caused by unexpected conditions that occur during the execution of the program.

For example, if you are working with a large dataset and your program runs out of memory, it will throw an OutOfMemoryError, which is a RuntimeException. This is not a programming error, but an unexpected condition that occurs during the execution of the program.

Similarly, if you are working with a database and the connection is lost, your program may throw a SQLException, which is a RuntimeException. Again, this is not a programming error, but an unexpected condition that occurs during the execution of the program.

So, while a RuntimeException is often caused by a programming error, it's not always the case. Some of these exceptions can be a result of unexpected conditions that occur during the execution of the program, and it's important to plan for and handle these conditions in your code.

 - can I use try-catch to circumvent a runtime exception?

You can use a try-catch block to catch a RuntimeException, but it's not always the best way to handle it.

When a RuntimeException is thrown, it indicates that there is a problem with the program's logic or state that needs to be addressed. Catching the exception with a try-catch block and then continuing to execute the program without addressing the underlying problem is not a good practice, as it can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs in the program.

Instead of using try-catch to circumvent a RuntimeException, it is recommended to use it to handle exceptional situations that occur during the execution of the program, and then fix the underlying problem that caused the exception. For example, if you are trying to access an element in an array and you get an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, you should check the index you are trying to access to make sure it's within the bounds of the array before trying to access it again.

Additionally, it's worth noting that the use of try-catch blocks should be kept to a minimum, as they can make the code harder to read, understand and maintain.

In summary, using try-catch to circumvent a RuntimeException is not recommended, and it's better to use it to handle unexpected conditions and fix the underlying problem that caused the exception.

## inner classes (static and non-static)

- can you know explain to me what inner-classes are and when to use them 

In Java, an inner class is a class that is defined within another class. Inner classes are used to group related classes together and to provide better encapsulation and organization of code.

There are two types of inner classes in Java: static and non-static inner classes.

A static inner class is defined as a static member of the outer class. It can be instantiated without an instance of the outer class and can access only static members of the outer class.

A non-static inner class, also known as inner class, is defined as a non-static member of the outer class. It requires an instance of the outer class to be instantiated and can access both static and non-static members of the outer class.

Here's an example of a non-static inner class:

class Outer {
    int x = 10;
    class Inner {
        int y = 5;
        public void display() {
            System.out.println(x + y);
        }
    }
}

In this example, the class Inner is defined within the class Outer. An instance of Outer class is required to create an instance of the Inner class and the Inner class can access the variable x of the outer class.

Inner classes can be useful in situations where a class is only used in the context of another class, or when you want to group related classes together to provide better encapsulation.

It's worth noting that Inner classes can also be used as anonymous classes and local classes. Anonymous classes are inner classes without a name and are used for creating an instance of a class at the same time as defining the class. Local classes are defined inside a method and are only accessible from within the method.

In conclusion, Inner classes can be useful for providing better encapsulation of code and for grouping related classes together. They are used in situations where a class is only used in the context of another class, and can be defined as static or non-static classes, anonymous and local classes.

- what do you mean by members of the outer class?

When referring to members of the outer class, I mean the variables and methods that are defined within the outer class.

In Java, an inner class has access to the members of the outer class, including its private members. This means that an inner class can access the variables and methods of the outer class, regardless of their access level (public, private, protected).

For example, in the previous example I gave, the inner class Inner has access to the variable x of the outer class Outer.

It's worth noting that an inner class can also have its own variables and methods that are independent of the outer class.

Additionally, an inner class can also access the static members of the outer class, but only if the inner class is static. A static inner class is defined as a static member of the outer class, it can be instantiated without an instance of the outer class and can access only static members of the outer class.

So, to sum up, members of the outer class refers to the variables and methods defined within an outer class, that an inner class has access to, regardless of their access level.

- so if I have a class List, a class Bag, and a class Element, and Element should be used by both List and Bag it's better if I leave it in its own file, instead if I need it only for List I can decide to make it an inner class, right?

Yes, that's correct. If the Element class is used by both the List and Bag classes, it would be better to leave it in its own file so that it can be reused by other parts of the program. This also makes the code more modular, and the Element class can be tested and reused independently of the List and Bag classes.

On the other hand, if the Element class is only used by the List class, and it's only used as an implementation detail of that class, it might make more sense to make it an inner class. This can improve encapsulation and organization of the code, and makes it clear that the Element class is specific to the List class.

It's worth noting that if you are going to make the Element class an inner class, it's a good practice to make it a private inner class to indicate that it is an implementation detail of the List class and not intended for use outside of the List class.

In conclusion, it depends on the use case and the design decisions you make, but in general, if the class is going to be used by multiple classes, it's better to leave it in its own file, but if it's only used as an implementation detail of another class, it might make sense to make it an inner class.

- why private? normally if I leave it public I can use it outside?

Yes, you're correct that if you make the inner class public, it can be used outside of the outer class. But making it private indicates that it is intended for use only within the outer class, and not intended to be used by other parts of the program. This is good practice as it improves encapsulation, and makes it clear that the inner class is an implementation detail of the outer class.

By making the inner class private, you are hiding the implementation details of the outer class and making it more robust to changes. If you make it public, other parts of the program can use it and depend on it, if you change it in the future, it can break the dependent code.

Additionally, making the inner class private also makes the code more readable and maintainable, as it clearly indicates the intended use and visibility of the inner class.

It's worth noting that if you want to expose some functionality of the inner class to other parts of the program, you can create public methods in the outer class that use the inner class and make it available in a controlled way.

In summary, making an inner class private indicates that it is intended for use only within the outer class, and it's a good practice for encapsulation and maintainability of the code.

- So referring to the previous example, if I wanted to instantiate an Element object (given that the inner class in which it's defined is set to public) without an instance of List, I could (given that it would have to be static)

I apologize, I made a mistake in my previous response. If the inner class Element is defined as public, it can be instantiated without an instance of the outer class List. However, it should be set as a static inner class if it needs to be instantiated without an instance of the outer class, otherwise it would need an instance of the outer class to be instantiated.

Here's an example of how to define the Element class as a public static inner class:

class List {
    public static class Element {
        // ...
    }
    // ...
}

In this example, the Element class is defined as a public static inner class, which means that it can be instantiated without an instance of the outer class List.

List.Element element = new List.Element();

It's worth noting that if the Element class is only used by the List class, and it's only used as an implementation detail of that class, it might make more sense to make it a private inner class, this can improve encapsulation and organization of the code. And if you need to use it outside of the List class, you can create public methods in the outer class that use the inner class and make it available in a controlled way.

## Generics

### Type constraint in method signature

- why this method signature contains <T> after static? public static<T> Vector<? extends Comparable<T> add(Vector<T> v) { ... }

In Java, when a method is defined with a generic type parameter, the type parameter is usually defined before the return type of the method. However, in this specific case, the method add is defined as a static method and it also has a type, this is why the type parameter T is defined after the keyword static in the method signature.

The method add takes a single parameter Vector<T> v and it returns a Vector<? extends Comparable<T>>. The Vector class is a type of collection that holds objects in a specific order, and it is defined with a generic type parameter E, where E is the type of elements in the vector.

In this case, the method add takes a Vector<T> as an input and returns a Vector of elements that are Comparable to T. The wildcard ? is used with the extends keyword to indicate that the returned vector can contain elements of any type that is Comparable to T. The use of the wildcard ? is a way to indicate that the returned vector is of an unknown specific type.

In conclusion, this method signature shows how a static method can be defined with a generic type parameter T and it takes a Vector<T> as an input and it returns a Vector<? extends Comparable<T>>. This allows the method to work with vectors of any type, as long as the elements of the vectors are Comparable to T.

- what changes in this case? public static<T extends Comparable<E>> Vector<T> add(Vector<T> v) { ... }

In this case, the method signature is slightly different, the method add is still defined as a static method, but the type parameter T is now defined with the keyword extends and Comparable<E>.

This means that the type parameter T is now constrained to be a subtype of Comparable<E>, which means that T must be a type that implements the Comparable interface, and is comparable to a type E.

This changes the way the method works, previously the method could work with any type, as long as the elements of the vectors are Comparable to T. Now, the method will only work with types that implement the Comparable interface and are comparable to E.

This means that the method will only accept Vector<T> where T is a type that implements the Comparable<E> interface and it returns a Vector<T> where T is a type that implements the Comparable<E> interface.

In conclusion, this method signature shows how a static method can be defined with a generic type parameter T and a constraint T extends Comparable<E>, this constrains the type parameter T to be a subtype of Comparable<E>, this means that the type parameter T must be a type that implements the Comparable interface and is comparable to a type E. This allows the method to work with a more specific set of types and improves the type safety.

- so in the first case <T> after the static keywork was useless?

Yes.

## Hashing

- Explain hashing, then explain in simple terms how to handle collisions, then put it in the context of a hashMap and hashSet

Hashing is the process of taking an input (or 'key'), and returning a fixed-size string of characters, which is a hash. This process is deterministic, meaning that the same input will always produce the same hash. Hashing is used to index and retrieve items in a database because it is faster to find the item using the shorter hashed key than to find it using the original value.

When multiple keys are mapped to the same index in a hash table, it is called a collision. One way to handle collisions is to use a technique called chaining. With chaining, each index in the hash table is associated with a linked list of items that have the same hash value. When a new item is added to the hash table, it is added to the linked list at the corresponding index. When searching for an item in the hash table, the item's hash value is used to find the appropriate linked list, and then the item is searched for in the linked list.

In the context of a HashMap and HashSet, collisions are handled using chaining. A HashMap is a data structure that stores key-value pairs, where keys are hashed to determine the index of the corresponding value in the table. A HashSet is a data structure that stores unique elements, where each element is hashed to determine the index where it is stored in the table.

## ArrayList constant time


- is hashing used in ArrayList<T>?

Hashing is not used in the implementation of the ArrayList class in Java. ArrayList is a dynamic array implementation of the List interface, which means that it stores its elements in a contiguous block of memory. It uses an array as its underlying data structure, and elements are accessed by their index in the array.

Elements in an ArrayList are accessed using an integer index, which is used to calculate the position of the element in the underlying array. It does not use a hashing function to map the elements to their positions in the array. The ArrayList class resizes its internal array as needed when elements are added or removed, and it uses an algorithm called amortized constant time to make sure that the average time complexity of adding and removing elements is constant.

In contrast, a HashMap or a HashSet use a hashing function to map the keys to their positions in the table, and use an array as an underlying data structure as well. They use the hash code of the key to calculate the index of the element in the array, and it uses chaining to handle collisions.

In summary, ArrayList does not use hashing to store its elements, it uses an array as its underlying data structure and access its elements by index, while a HashMap or a HashSet use a hashing function to map the keys to their positions in the table and use chaining to handle collisions.

- what's amortized constant time

Amortized constant time is a term used to describe the average time complexity of a sequence of operations over a period of time. In the context of an ArrayList class, it refers to the average time complexity of adding and removing elements.

When an ArrayList is full and a new element is added, the internal array needs to be resized to accommodate the new element. Resizing the array can be an expensive operation, taking O(n) time, where n is the number of elements in the array. However, if we consider the sequence of operations over a period of time, the number of resizing operations is usually small compared to the total number of add operations.

This means that, over time, the average time complexity of adding an element to an ArrayList is constant, even though a single add operation can take O(n) time. The same applies for the remove operation.

Therefore, the ArrayList class uses amortized constant time to describe the average time complexity of adding and removing elements. This means that, over a period of time, the average time complexity of adding and removing elements is constant, even though a single operation can take O(n) time.

- is there a way to predict what's the best amount of spaces to resize the underlying array of ArrayList to?

Predicting the best amount of space to resize the underlying array of an ArrayList is a trade-off between space and performance, and it depends on the specific use case and the expected behavior of the application.

In general, if an application is expected to frequently add and remove elements, it would be beneficial to allocate more space than needed to avoid frequent resizing operations. On the other hand, if the ArrayList is expected to have a stable size and memory usage is a concern, it would be beneficial to allocate the minimum amount of space needed.

A good strategy could be to use a load factor, a value that represents the ratio of the number of elements in the ArrayList to the number of spaces in the underlying array, for example, a load factor of 0.75 means that the ArrayList is allowed to fill 75% of the underlying array before it is resized.

In the Java implementation of ArrayList, the default load factor is 0.75 and it's used to determine the new size of the underlying array when it's resized. The new size is calculated by multiplying the current size with the load factor when the array is expanded, and dividing it by the load factor when it's shrinked.

Another strategy could be to use a power of 2 as the size of the underlying array, this can help to reduce the number of resizing operations, especially when the size of the list is growing, and it also helps to reduce the memory fragmentation.

In summary, there's no way to predict the best amount of space to resize the underlying array of ArrayList to, it's a trade-off between space and performance and it depends on the specific use case and the expected behavior of the application, but a good strategy could be to use a load factor or a power of 2 as the size of the underlying array.
